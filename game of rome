     A) Introduction:
     This game follows the path of an aspiring young statesman in ancient Rome.
     After a brief introduction it is set in three stages.
     
     1. Getting rich: Raise money with three seperate minigames.
     2. Senate: Win the support of the Senate to obtain a military command.
     3. Battle: Defeat an enemy army.
     
     B) Known Bugs:
     All numbers have to be entered as integers. 
     Writing them out in words as a strg is controlled for and will not 
     trigger an error message, but it will not be accepted as input.
